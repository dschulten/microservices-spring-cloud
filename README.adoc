= Microservice Example

Using Consul, Traefik and Camel Spring Boot

== Traefik-Gateway

To list Traefik commands

    docker run traefik:v1.7 --help

To build

    docker build -t traefik-gateway .

== Registrator

Registers docker containers with Consul using service tags that are evaluated by Traefik.

When started with `-internal` option, it is sufficient when a container's description exposes its internal ports to other services to make it accessible to Traefik.

== Microservices

To run the microservices

    docker-compose up                  # stop with ctrl+c
    docker-compose up --remove-orphans # remove unused containers
    docker-compose up -d               # run detached or update running stack
    docker-compose up --scale rest=2   # scale service
    docker-compose logs -f             # follow logs
